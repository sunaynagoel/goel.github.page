EWG's Skin Deep® cosmetic database gives people practical solutions to protect themselves and their families from everyday exposures to potentially toxic chemicals in personal care and beauty products. Skin Deep®, launched in 2004, lists easy-to-navigate hazard ratings for nearly 70,000 products and 9,000 ingredients on the market. The U.S. government doesn't review the toxicity of products before they're sold. Companies are allowed to use almost any ingredient they wish without regard for how safe they are. The aim of Skin Deep® is to fill in where industry and government leave off.​
we are proud to announce our products carry EWG Skin Deep [rating](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search?utf8=✓&search=ame+body+care) of 1-3. 
You can find out how safe is your product by entering ingredients, brand or product by following this [link](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep). and be prepared to be suprised.
