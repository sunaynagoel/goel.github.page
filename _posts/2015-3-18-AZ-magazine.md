From Arizona Health and Living Magazine:
Here at Arizona Health & Living, we know that the key to a happier lifestyle is a healthier one - and we're all about improving the health of our communities, one reader at a time. Our publications serve as a unique voice for the communities-- a place where readers can not only find out about the latest in health and lifestyle news, but where they can get the resources they read about from places in their own backyard. At Arizona Health & Living, we strive in the faith of empowering our readers to make positive decisions that not only impact their health, but the health of the community they call home and to spread healthy living information that will enlighten everyone to know that the word health is not just about physical fitness but rather a combination of the mind, body and spirit - and when balanced, creates a synergy of well-being and healthy living.
