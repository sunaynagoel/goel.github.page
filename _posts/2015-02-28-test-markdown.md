Ame Body Care carries an amazing line of body scrubs and bath crystals that are made of natural, organic and certified food grade ingredients free of chemicals, preservatives and dyes.  These eco-friendly products nourish, hydrate, cleanse and rejuvenate skin and would make a perfect gift for mom this holiday season.
Their products are hand crafted from age old recipes passed on from generation to generation and are combined with natural flavors that are so aromatic you almost want to eat them!  I received the coffee scented body scrub and it has such a strong scent.  Perfect for the coffee lover !!!
If you love body care products as much as I do, you may want to join one of their monthly clubs.  You will receive one scent every month along with any limited collection seasonal scents.  Choose between the Bath Crystal Club, the Body Scrub Club or the Surprise Me Club.  This would be a gift that keeps giving for 6 months !!!
Also, I really like that they donate a portion of every one of its sales to the March of Dimes which is a non-profit that works towards healthy mothers and babies.  Treat yourself while knowing some of your money is helping others.
