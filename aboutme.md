### history

âme Body Care was started in 2013 as an effort to eliminate chemical and dye from our lives. Skin is the largest organ of our body. Everything we put on our skin find a way into our blood stream. While we are making lifestyle changes with organic and natural food, it make sense to have access to clean skin care products.  We started our operation with Body Scrubs and Bath Crystals. Now we are making body butter, lip balms, body oils and soaps as well. Please [contact us](https://www.facebook.com/amebody/) if you have any questions.
